# Unit Test Isolation with PHP

This repository contains all the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "Unit Test Isolation: How to Master External Dependencies (PHP)".

In this video, we dive into the crucial practice of unit test isolation. This project demonstrates why it's so important to isolate your tests from external dependencies, such as databases, APIs, or even "real-world" concerns like the current time.

## What You'll Learn
  - Why test isolation is a fundamental skill for writing robust unit tests.
  - How to replace external dependencies with Test Doubles.
  - Practical techniques for handling time-dependent code.
  - The key to writing fast, reliable, and predictable tests.
